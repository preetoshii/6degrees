I have {{count}} potential parent categories for "{{orphan}}":
{{candidatesList}}

Requirements:

- Consider semantic relationships, not just surface similarity
- The relationship "{{orphan}} is a type of [parent]" should make intuitive sense

Which single category best serves as the parent for "{{orphan}}"?
Reply with exactly one choice from the list above, nothing else.
