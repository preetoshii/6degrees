# Phase 1: Roles Generation Prompt
# Used in: phase1_tree_growth.js
# Purpose: Generate functional roles/purposes for a word (only when applicable)
# Variables: {{min}}, {{max}}, {{word}}
# Returns: Comma-separated gerunds/functional nouns or "NONE"

For the word "{{word}}", determine if it has a primary functional purpose.

Tools, professions, and service systems have functional purposes:
- Hammer → hammering, building
- Teacher → teaching, educating
- Hospital → healing, treating

Most things do NOT have functional purposes:
- Animals (Cat, Dog) → NONE
- Abstract categories (Thing, Object, Concept) → NONE
- Natural objects (Tree, Rock) → NONE
- General categories (System, Place) → NONE

If "{{word}}" has a clear functional purpose, list {{min}}-{{max}} gerunds (verb+ing).
Otherwise, return exactly: NONE

Examples:
- "Hammer": hammering, building, demolishing
- "Thing": NONE
- "Object": NONE
- "System": NONE
