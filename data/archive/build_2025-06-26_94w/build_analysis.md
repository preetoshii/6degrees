# Build Analysis - 2025-06-26

## Build Configuration
- Target Words: 100 (achieved 94)
- Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
- Key Parameters: 
  - Children: 3-5 per word
  - Traits: 3-5 per word
  - Acquaintances: 3-5 per word
  - Similarity threshold: 0.8

## Test Results

### Structural Integrity
- [✓] Graph Connectivity: 94/94 connected (100%)
- [✓] Cycle Prevention: 0 cycles detected
- [✓] Relationship Validity: ~90% valid (manual inspection)

### Semantic Quality
- [✓] Taxonomic Coherence: Generally good
  - Cat → Animal → Thing ✓
  - Hammer promoted to role ✓
  - Some oddities: "whisker" as child of Thing
- [✗] Trait Appropriateness: MAJOR ISSUE
  - Only 0.13 traits per word average (expected 3-5)
  - Many words have placeholder "trait1" 
  - Real traits only for ~10% of words
- [✗] Acquaintance Relevance: PARTIAL ISSUE
  - 0.49 acquaintances per word (expected 3-5)
  - Many have placeholder "acquaintance1-4"
  - Good examples: Cat → litter box, whiskers ✓

### Clustering Effectiveness
- [✓] Trait Clusters: 4 promoted traits from 32 raw (87.5% reduction)
  - "complex", "playful", "trait1" promoted successfully
- [✓] Roles Identified: 2 roles promoted
  - "companion", "solar" correctly identified

### Game Design Alignment
- [✗] Average connections per word: 2.66 (TOO LOW - expected 4-7)
- [✗] Puzzle path diversity: Limited due to sparse connections
- [✗] 79/94 words have only 1-2 connections (84%!)

## What Worked

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: The parent-child relationships are semantically sound
   - Animals, Objects, Concepts properly organized
   - No cycles detected

2. **Orphan Adoption**: 100% success rate
   - All acquaintances found appropriate parents
   - Examples: "whisker" → Thing, "litter box" → Object

3. **Role Identification**: Correctly identified functional words
   - "companion" and "solar" appropriately promoted

## What Failed

1. **Trait Generation**: CRITICAL FAILURE
   - Hypothesis: The API returned error messages like "Could you please specify the object you're referring to?" for abstract words
   - Many words defaulted to placeholder "trait1"
   - Prompt may be too vague for abstract concepts

2. **Acquaintance Generation**: PARTIAL FAILURE  
   - Similar issue - abstract words got placeholders
   - Concrete words (Cat, Dog) worked well
   - Abstract words (Thing, Concept) failed

3. **Connection Sparsity**: MAJOR ISSUE
   - 84% of words are poorly connected
   - Hypothesis: Only processed ~50 words before timeout/completion
   - Many leaf nodes never got their children/traits/acquaintances generated

## Detective Deep Dive

### Pattern Analysis:
- **Successful words**: Concrete, mid-level concepts (Cat, Dog, Furniture)
- **Failed words**: Abstract top-level (Thing, System) and unprocessed leaves

### Root Causes:
1. **Incomplete Processing**: Build stopped at 94/100 words, likely left many without metadata
2. **Prompt Ambiguity**: "List traits for Object" → "Please specify which object"
3. **Abstract Word Handling**: LLM struggles with traits for abstract concepts

## Changes for Next Build

1. **Fix Trait/Acquaintance Prompts**:
   ```
   OLD: "List 3-5 adjectives most people associate with Object"
   NEW: "List 3-5 adjectives commonly used to describe any Object (as a general category)"
   ```

2. **Add Context to Prompts**:
   - Include parent category for context
   - Add examples in prompt for abstract words

3. **Ensure Complete Processing**:
   - Check why some words have no stages.childrenDone
   - Add progress tracking to see where processing stops

4. **Separate Abstract/Concrete Prompts**:
   - Detect word abstractness level
   - Use different prompt strategies

5. **Increase Base Connectivity**:
   - Process ALL words completely before stopping
   - Consider adding more acquaintances between existing words

## Recommendations

- This build is NOT production ready
- Connection density too low for engaging gameplay
- Need to fix trait/acquaintance generation before next build
- Consider smaller test (25 words) to debug prompts first
